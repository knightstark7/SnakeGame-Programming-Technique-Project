2. **Introduction**:
In this part, we use some class techniques and basic data structure to build a simple game
of snake. To complete this project, we need to know some basic knowledge: file
processing, one/two-dimensional array… This guideline only helps students to build the
basic game. You should research many problems and do your best.

3. **Goals**:
- Process the case the head of snake touches its body
- Save/load
- Keeping the length unchanged
- Process the gate
- Provide animation
- Provide main menu
